## DATA UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS
## Source of Data
The primary datasets used in this project is data  obtained from IMDb and BOM Movies.
## Description of Data
The datasets are in form of an SQLite Database and a CSV File.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before conducting analysis, the collected data undergoes a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. This process involves:

Handling missing values: Imputing or removing missing data points as appropriate.

Standardizing formats: Ensuring uniform formatting for categorical variables, such as genre classifications and release dates.

Correcting errors: Identifying and rectifying any inconsistencies or anomalies in the data.

Removing duplicates: Eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying patterns and trends within the box office data. Key steps in the EDA process include:

Descriptive statistics: Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical variables such as revenue, budget, and ratings.

Data visualization: Creating visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts) to explore relationships between variables and identify trends.

Conclusion
-It is clear from the above visualization that the foreign gross revenue exceded the domestic gross revenue making it a favourable market for Microsoft.

-The domestic revenue also shows a lot of promise considering the margins between the two though more marketing strategies need to be put in place to grow this revenue stream.
